A comprehensive, production-ready driver monitoring system that provides real-time detection of driver drowsiness, phone usage, and safety compliance with enterprise-grade features including data privacy, performance optimization, and comprehensive analytics.

## Project Overview

RideBuddy is an innovative driver safety solution that monitors driver behavior using in-cabin cameras. This secondary AI model runs in the cloud to verify and refine drowsiness detection by distinguishing genuine drowsy events from distractions caused by mobile phone usage.

## Features

- **Drowsiness vs Distraction Classification**: Accurately classifies driver states
- **Phone Usage Detection**: Detects various phone holding styles and usage patterns
- **Seatbelt Detection**: Monitors seatbelt compliance
- **Multi-condition Support**: Handles different lighting conditions, drivers, and occlusions
- **Lightweight Model**: Optimized for edge deployment with minimal compute requirements
- **Real-time Inference**: Suitable for in-vehicle deployment

## Model Architecture

The system uses a multi-task learning approach with:
- **Backbone**: EfficientNet-B0 or MobileNetV3 for feature extraction
- **YOLO Integration**: For object detection (phone, hands, seatbelt)
- **Classification Head**: For drowsiness/distraction classification
- **Optimization**: Model quantization and pruning for edge deployment
