🔧 RideBuddy Camera Issue - RESOLVED ✅
==============================================

## 🐛 Problem Identified
The camera was initializing successfully but was not starting capture until the user manually clicked "Start Monitoring". This meant:
- No camera preview was available after initialization
- Users couldn't see if the camera was working properly
- Desktop mode required manual intervention to see camera feed

## 🔍 Root Cause
1. **Missing Auto-Capture**: Camera initialization did not automatically start capture for preview
2. **Consent Timing**: Camera initialization only occurred after privacy consent, but no auto-initialization was triggered after consent acceptance
3. **Desktop Mode Limitation**: Unlike vehicle mode, desktop mode didn't auto-start camera preview

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Fixed Consent-to-Camera Flow**
```python
def accept_consent():
    self.user_consent = True
    logging.info("User accepted privacy consent")
    consent_dialog.destroy()
    # Initialize camera after consent is accepted
    if OPENCV_AVAILABLE:
        print("[CAMERA] Initializing camera after consent acceptance...")
        self.root.after(500, self.initialize_camera)
```

### 2. **Auto-Start Camera Capture for Preview**
```python
def init_thread():
    success = self.camera_manager.initialize_camera(camera_index)
    if success:
        self.root.after_idle(lambda: self.update_camera_status("Connected", "green"))
        print(f"[CAMERA] Camera {camera_index} initialized successfully")
        
        # Start camera capture for preview (both vehicle and desktop mode)
        capture_success = self.camera_manager.start_capture()
        if capture_success:
            print(f"[CAMERA] Camera capture started for preview")
        else:
            print(f"[CAMERA] Warning: Failed to start camera capture")
```

### 3. **Removed Redundant Auto-Initialize**
Removed conflicting auto-initialization logic that was checking consent before the dialog was shown.
