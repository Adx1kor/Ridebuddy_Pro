### ⚠️ **CRITICAL CONCERNS FOR VEHICLE DEPLOYMENT**

#### 1. **Synthetic Data Dependency** 🚨
```
Real vs Synthetic Breakdown:
- Synthetic Data: ~9,500 samples (95%)
- Real Data: ~500 samples (5%)
- Augmented Real: Processed from 64 drowsy + 282 phone videos
```

**Risk Level**: **HIGH**
- **Issue**: Model trained primarily on synthetic data
- **Impact**: May not generalize to real vehicle conditions
- **Consequence**: Potential safety failures in edge cases

#### 2. **Limited Real-World Diversity** ⚠️
```
Missing Diversity Factors:
- Lighting: Limited dawn/dusk/night scenarios
- Demographics: Single dataset source
- Vehicle Types: No truck/SUV/different interiors
- Weather: No rain/snow/fog conditions
- Geography: Single regional dataset
```

**Risk Level**: **MEDIUM-HIGH**
- **Issue**: Insufficient environmental variation
- **Impact**: Performance degradation in diverse conditions

#### 3. **Safety-Critical Detection Gaps** 🛑
```
Critical Scenarios Not Adequately Covered:
- Micro-sleep episodes (< 2 seconds)
- Partial phone obstruction
- Sunglasses/prescription glasses interference
- Medical emergencies (seizures, heart attack)
- Extreme head positions (looking back)
```

**Risk Level**: **HIGH**
- **Issue**: False negatives could cause accidents
- **Impact**: Life-threatening safety failures
