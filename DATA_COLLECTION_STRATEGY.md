## 🚨 **CRITICAL DECISION POINT**

**The current model is functional for demonstration and research but REQUIRES significant data expansion for production deployment in safety-critical applications.**

**Investment in comprehensive data collection is ESSENTIAL for:**
- ✅ Regulatory compliance
- ✅ Liability protection  
- ✅ User safety assurance
- ✅ Commercial viability
- ✅ Competitive performance

**Without additional data collection, deployment should be limited to non-safety-critical research and demonstration purposes only.**
